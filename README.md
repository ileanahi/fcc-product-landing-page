# Product Landing Page
This landing page fulfills one of the requirements for the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design certifications. 

## Technology used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4

## Process
I reviewed the [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page) and inserted the items necessary to fulfill them. I then went through and input text, videos, and pricing to showcase the product. I went through a few iterations and experimented with designs to get to the page that I have now.
